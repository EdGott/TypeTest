# TypeTest
* by, Ed Gotthardt

This is a typing test that I created to help me study for both  my CS midterm and my English midterm at the same time.

The mistake counter/printer are things that I need to work on more for this project.

I found the formula for calculating WPM online so I'm not sure how accurate it is yet I believe it is quite close.
